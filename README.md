# Sublime JavaScript
JavaScript syntax highlighting for [SublimeText 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with support for es201x, [jsx](https://jsx.github.io/) and [flow](https://flowtype.org/) (tested only in [dev](https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev) builds, but should work starting from [Build 3103](https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-build-3103), with introduction of [.sublime-syntax](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html))

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, just clone this repo to your packages folder (Preferences -> Browser Packages... in sublime menu) and start hacking.

Even if you don't understand what's going on here, you could help writing tests (they just describe what should be highlighted and how, see tests folder).
